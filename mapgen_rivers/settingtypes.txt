# File containing all settings for 'mapgen_rivers' mod.

#    Represents horizontal map scale. Every cell of the grid will be upscaled to
#    a square of this size.
#    For example if the grid size is 1000x1000 and block size is 12,
#    the actual size of the map will be 15000.

mapgen_rivers_sea_level (Sea level) int 1

#    Minimal catchment area for a river to be drawn, in grid cells
#    (1 cell = blocksize x blocksize).
#    Lower value means bigger river density
mapgen_rivers_min_catchment (Minimal catchment area) float 25.0 1.0 1000.0

#    Catchment area in grid cells (1 grid cell = blocksize x blocksize)
#    at which rivers reach their maximal width of 2*blocksize.
#    Higher value means a river needs to receive more tributaries to grow in width.

#    Lateral slope of the riverbed.
#    Higher value means deeper rivers.

#    Enable horizontal distorsion (shearing) of landscape, to break the regularity
#    of grid cells and allow overhangs.
#    Distorsion uses two 3D noises and thus is intensive in terms of computing time.
mapgen_rivers_distort (Distorsion) bool true

#    Enable biome generation.
#    If 'biomegen' mod is installed, 'mapgen_rivers' will generate biomes from the
#    native biome system. If 'biomegen' is not present, will generate only grass and
#    snow.
mapgen_rivers_biomes (Biomes) bool true

#    Whether to enable glaciers.
#    Glaciers are widened river sections, covered by ice, that are generated in
#    very cold areas.
mapgen_rivers_glaciers (Glaciers) bool false

#    River channels are widened by this factor if they are a glacier.
mapgen_rivers_glacier_widening_factor (Glacier widening factor) float 8.0 1.0 20.0

#    Temperature value decreases by this quantity for every node, vertically.
#    This results in mountains being more covered by snow.
